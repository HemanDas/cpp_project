# Constructor Overloading in C++
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In C++, We can have more than one constructor in a class with same name, as long as each has a different list of arguments.This concept is known as Constructor Overloading and is quite similar to function overloading.

    *Overloaded constructors essentially have the same name (name of the class) and different number of arguments
    *A constructor is called depending upon the number and type of arguments passed.
    *A constructor is called depending upon the number and type of arguments passed.

**In the program contruct_overloading.cpp**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    *When p is created, the first constructor is called. x is initialized to 5 and y is initialized to 10.
    *When p1 is created, the second constructor is called. We have passed the arguments 10 and 20. x is initialized to the first argument 10 and y is initialized to 20.
